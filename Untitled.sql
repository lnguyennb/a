Trump has quietly begun diverting more of the money he is raising away from his 2024 presidential campaign and into a political action committee that he has used to pay his personal legal fees.\r\n\r\nThe change, which went unannounced except in the fine print of his online disclosures, raises fresh questions about how Mr. Trump is paying for his mounting legal bills — which could run into millions of dollars — as he prepares for at least two criminal trials, and whether his PAC, Save America, is facing a financial crunch.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Trump kicked off his 2024 campaign in November, for every dollar raised online, 99 cents went to his campaign, and a penny went to Save America.\r\n\r\nBut internet archival records show that sometime in February or March, he adjusted that split. Now his campaign’s share has been reduced to 90 percent of donations, and 10 percent goes to Save America.\r\n\r\nThe effect of that change is potentially substantial: Based on fund-raising figures announced by his campaign, the fine-print maneuver may already have diverted at least $1.5 million to Save America.\r\n\r\nAnd the existence of the group has allowed Mr. Trump to have his small donors pay for his legal expenses, rather than paying for them himself.\r\n\r\nSteven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, did not answer detailed questions about why the Trump operation has changed how the funds he is raising are being split. Save America technically owns the list of email addresses and phone numbers of his supporters — one of the former president’s most valuable assets — and the campaign is effectively paying the PAC for access to that list, he explained.\r\n\r\n“Because the campaign wants to ensure every dollar donated to President Trump is spent in the most cost-effective manner, a fair-market analysis was conducted to determine email list rentals would be more efficient by amending the fund-raising split between the two entities,” Mr. Cheung said in a written statement.','2023-06-26',5,1),(34,'Novak Djokovic Captures the French Open and a 23rd Grand Slam Title','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/11/multimedia/11french-men-final8-wmfq/11french-men-final8-wmfq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp','Djokovic beat Casper Ruud to win the men’s singles championship, passing Rafael Nadal for the most major tournament titles in the Open era.','Novak Djokovic began his day picturing how it would end, holding his children in his arms, raising another Grand Slam tournament trophy above his head and singing his national anthem as Serbian fans chanted and danced and celebrated his third French Open men’s singles title and much more.','2023-06-26',1,1),(35,'Novak Djokovic Captures the French Open and a 23rd Grand Slam Title','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/11/multimedia/11french-men-final8-wmfq/11french-men-final8-wmfq-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp','Djokovic beat Casper Ruud to win the men’s singles championship, passing Rafael Nadal for the most major tournament titles in the Open era.','Novak Djokovic began his day picturing how it would end, holding his children in his arms, raising another Grand Slam tournament trophy above his head and singing his national anthem as Serbian fans chanted and danced and celebrated his third French Open men’s singles title and much more.','2023-06-26',1,1);
