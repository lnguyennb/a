The founder, Fabian Kramer, also works with fire to produce the artisanal ceramic vessels that decorate the space. Mischa Amadeus Olma, a founder of Woodcuisine, arranges foraging workshops and dinners outdoors (currently in an herb garden in the leafy Mariendorf neighborhood) where he and friends offer a changing menu — one evening it was fire-grilled trout and a dessert of pancakes served with freshly foraged honeycomb — that is cooked on the sides of a steel fire ring forged by the Swiss sculptor Andreas Reichlin.

But across the floor and atop tables are lumpy earthen depictions of tree-dwelling creatures beside prominent historical figures like the American novelist Gertrude Stein. The cross-species interactions are mostly benign, as in a vignette where a girl seated on a stump is flanked by two kind-looking roosters. But some have more of an editorializing bite: To address her frustrations with Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s abortion rulings, Saul cast him as being eternally tormented by three pudgy spiders. “Some pieces are sweeter, and then I think, ‘I want to make something that’s fiercer,’” she says. “I go back and forth.”','2023-07-09',4,8),(61,'A New Line of Subtle, Glamorous Clothes','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/21/t-magazine/fashion/21tmag-michelle-rhee-slide-6CT4-copy/21tmag-michelle-rhee-slide-6CT4-videoLarge.jpg','The debut collection from the designer Michelle Rhee’s namesake line balances romantic draping with precise men’s wear-inspired silhouettes.','As a child, the fashion designer Michelle Rhee was rather shy and fascinated by how, in lieu of spoken words, clothes could communicate on behalf of their wearer. “That always gave me a sense of confidence,” says Rhee, who’s drawn to minimal but evocative aesthetic objects of all kinds. No wonder that, when she studied art history in college, she was taken with German Expressionism, the early 20th-century movement whose practitioners dispensed with strict realism, leading instead with their emotions. “There’s a classicness to those paintings, and yet they’re charged with so much energy,” says Rhee, 33.

Make art, live alone, have children, don’t have children: A woman’s choices are often circumscribed by the era in which she is born, and then again by how tolerant, encouraging or generous the men in her life — beginning with her father — are. Poor women’s lives are circumscribed further; women marginalized because of their race, sexuality or ability, further still.\r\n\r\nI suspect many women, in America and around the world, feel they’re in a state of whiplash as they’ve witnessed hard-won freedoms and rights become imperiled in recent years. I always say that history is not a line but a loop, and it’s been dismaying and frightening for many to watch as we tumble down the other side of the curve. Yet if being a woman means always looking backward — to remind us of where we were, what we must avoid and how our predecessors managed in their own difficult circumstances — it means looking forward, too, as part of the ongoing exercise of hope that is also intrinsic to womanhood.','2023-07-09',4,8),(63,'The Vietnamese American Artists Searching for Identity','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/06/20/t-magazine/20tmag-vietnam-slide-GOFO/20tmag-vietnam-slide-GOFO-videoLarge.jpg','Postwar refugees who’ve used their art to express complicated feelings of loss and home.','An-My Lê can barely recall the Hawaiian shirt that the blond American wore when he put her into a black cargo van.

The city was bracing for the Quân đội nhân dân Việt Nam, the Communist army of the North, and the Việt Cộng, the guerilla-style militant groups from South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, to capture the capital of Việt Nam Cộng hòa — what the United States and the rest of the Western Bloc knew as the Republic of Vietnam. Lê spent that night on the military tarmac of Saigon’s Tan Son Nhut Air Base with her father and two brothers. When dawn broke, she took one last glance at the landscape through the windows of the American C-130 aircraft as it disappeared into the clouds. She was 15.\r\n\r\nComplicated emotions of uncertainty and anger, guilt and abandonment all intersect for artists from Lê’s generation; those who are not fully Vietnamese in Vietnam nor American in America.

Yellen is the second Cabinet official to visit the country in recent weeks, following a highly anticipated trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month.\r\n\r\nBurgum, a relative unknown in the crowded GOP presidential field, has gone on an ad blitz in key early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. In one early ad titled “Why.” Burgum highlighted U.S.-China relations as a key pillar of his campaign.\r\n\r\n“Why run? First, fix this crazy economy. Second, unleash American energy production. Third, rebuild our military to win the Cold War with China,” Burgum says in the clip.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the multimillionaire ex-software executive also knocked former President Donald Trump, telling NBC’s Chuck Todd he would not do business with the GOP front-runner. When Todd pressed him on why, Burgum replied: “I just think that it’s important that you’re judged by the company you keep.”\r\n\r\nBurgum also talked about his stance on abortion, one of more dedicate issues the GOP field faces, saying he did not support a federal ban.\r\n\r\n“My position is that I support the Dobbs decision, and this is the decision that should be left to the states,” Burgum said. “And what’s going to pass in North Dakota is not ever going to pass in California and New York, and wouldn’t even pass in the state of Minnesota. … That’s why I’m on the record saying that I would not sign a federal abortion ban.”\r\n\r\nAbortion and other culture-war issues, like legislation limiting the rights of transgender people, shouldn’t be the focus of the commander-in-chief, Burgum said.\r\n\r\n“We need a president that’s focused on the challenges that we’re being faced as a nation — not a president that’s going to decide whether a book is in the right section or not in a library in a small town somewhere in America.”\r\n\r\n“It’s definitely not the place where the president should be spending their time,” he added.\r\n\r\n','2023-07-09',5,4),(66,'U.N. chief says Sudan on the brink of ‘full-scale civil war’','https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/c358890/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6953x4548+0+0/resize/1920x1256!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6c%2F46%2Fdcc016d24dca8d0e993673d454be%2Fkenya-sudan-un-guterres-28408.jpg','The African nation has seen nearly three months of fighting.','CAIRO — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Sudan was on the brink of a “full-scale civil war” as fierce clashes between rival generals continued unabated Sunday in the capital, Khartoum.\r\n\r\nHe warned on Saturday evening that the war between the Sudanese military and a powerful paramilitary force is likely to destabilize the entire region, according to Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the secretary-general.\r\n\r\nSudan descended into chaos after months of tension between military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and his rival Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open fighting in mid-April.\r\n\r\nHealth Minister Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim said in televised comments last month that the clashes have killed over 3,000 people and wounded over 6,000 others. The death tally, however, is highly likely to be much higher. More than 2.9 million people have fled their homes to safer areas inside Sudan or crossed into neighboring countries, according to U.N. figures.\r\n\r\nThe fighting came 18 months after the two generals led a military coup in October 2021 that toppled a Western-backed civilian transitional government. The conflict dashed Sudanese hopes of a peaceful transition to democracy after a popular uprising forced the military removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.\r\n\r\nThe war has turned the capital Khartoum and other urban areas across the country into battlefields.\r\n\r\nResidents in Khartoum said fierce fighting was underway early Sunday south of the capital. The warring factions were using heavy weapons in the battles in the Kalaka neighborhood and the military’s aircraft were seen hovering over the area, said resident Abdalla al-Fatih.\r\n\r\nIn his statement, Guterres also condemned an airstrike Saturday that health authorities said killed at least 22 people in Omdurman, a city just across the Nile from the capital, Khartoum. The assault was one of the deadliest in the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe RSF blamed the military for the attack in Omdurman. The military, in turn, denied the accusation saying in a statement Sunday that its air force didn’t carry out any airstrikes in the city that day.\r\n\r\nThe secretary-general also decried the large-scale violence and casualties in the western region of Darfur, which has experienced some of the worst fighting in the ongoing conflict, Haq said in a statement.\r\n\r\n“There is an utter disregard for humanitarian and human rights law that is dangerous and disturbing,” Guterres said.\r\n\r\nU.N. officials have said the violence in the region has recently taken an ethnic dimension, with the RSF and Arab militias reportedly targeting non-Arab tribes in Darfur, a sprawling region consisting of five provinces. Last month, the governor of Darfur, Mini Arko Minawi, said the region was sliding back to its past genocide, referring to the conflict that engulfed the region in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nEntire towns and villages in West Darfur province were overrun by the RSF and their allied militias, forcing tens of thousands of residents to flee to neighboring Chad. Activists have reported many residents killed, women and girls raped, and properties looted and burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere were clashes between the military and the RSF elsewhere in Sudan on Sunday including the province of North Kordofan, South Kordofan and Blue Nile.','2023-07-09',5,4),(67,'Religious right gets blindsided by angry parents in a Southern California school district','https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/8a3a728/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3896x2597+0+0/resize/1920x1280!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F59%2F348b70a64e65956bb20bbf940e73%2Fap22351701853957-edit.jpg','Novice school board members get a hard lesson in politics in a region that could determine control of the House.','TEMECULA, Calif. — Three Southern California school board members backed by a far-right pastor narrowly won election last fall in campaigns fueled by pandemic rage.\r\n\r\nThen they banned critical race theory and rejected social studies materials that included LGBTQ rights hero Harvey Milk.\r\n\r\nNow, they’re fighting for their political lives.\r\n\r\nAfter just six months in office, those officials face a recall effort on top of a civil rights investigation launched by the state’s Democratic-led education department. Students have held protests, and irate parents and teachers are swarming the board’s meetings, feeling that their town — the fast-growing, politically diverse suburb of Temecula in Riverside County — has become consumed by partisan warfare.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want culture wars. We don’t want Fox News appearances,” Alex Douvas, a parent of two kids in the district who previously worked for two Republican congressmembers in Orange County, told the board recently. “Our schools are not ideological battlegrounds. They’re not platforms for religious evangelism. These are institutions for learning and growth.”\r\n\r\nThe religious right saw an opening to jump into the parental rights movement amid intense backlash about pandemic-era school closures and mask mandates. But those policies have all but disappeared in schools, and it’s proving harder to sustain that level of outrage over teachings on race and gender. The effort to ban certain books and challenge curriculum has split Republicans and polled poorly with independent voters nationally.\r\n\r\nLocal Democrats see the strategy flopping — and are already looking to capitalize on it in a part of the state that has become a battleground for control of the House. Joy Silver, chair of the Riverside County Democrats, said she’s intensely focused on winning down-ballot races like school board seats “because the battles are taking place there.”\r\n\r\nIn Temecula, the political agenda embraced by school board trustees Joseph Komrosky, Danny Gonzalez and Jen Wiersma has set off a different kind of public outrage than was likely intended. The booing and shouting at a recent public hearing grew so loud that the board president — who appeared to be wearing a bullet-proof vest under his sweater — cleared the room.\r\n\r\n“To the extent you keep it focused on parents and students first, not teachers, I think there’s room where you can push back on quote-unquote “woke” agenda issues, but if you go too far in the other direction and are trying to make that the only issue you care about, I think you’re going to see predictable backlash,” California GOP consultant Rob Stutzman said in an interview. “I look at something like Temecula, and to me it’s an eye roll.”\r\n\r\nA similar ethos has dominated the campaigns of Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has made curriculum restrictions and “parental rights” a centerpiece of his bid for the GOP nomination. It could also factor into local and congressional races, particularly in inland California, where Republicans are likely to face strong challenges from the left in 2024.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to say it’s a particularly Republican Party issue, because everyone who is upset by this is not necessarily Democratic, but the people who are causing the trouble are the extremists of that party,” Silver said.','2023-07-09',5,4),(68,'Dems’ mission to stop a third-party presidential bid hits the Hill','https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a5ac49e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4300x2867+0+0/resize/1920x1280!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F9a%2F30aa09a5410e80689ac2304ee9fb%2Fdebt-limit-01516.jpg','Officials from progressive MoveOn and centrist Third Way are planning to brief Senate Democratic chiefs of staff about the risk it could pose to President Joe Biden.','Democrats are mounting a coordinated mission to kill a third-party presidential bid — and it’s coming soon to Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nOfficials from the progressive group MoveOn and centrist group Third Way are planning to brief Senate Democratic chiefs of staff on July 27, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.

The security guard reaches out and hits Spears’ arm, which in turn appears to collide with her face.','2023-07-09',6,7),(74,'Taylor Swift Swaps Out Controversial ‘Better Than Revenge’ Lyrics on ‘Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)’','https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Taylor-Swift-Enchanted-Speak-Now-Taylors-Version.jpg?w=1581&h=1054&crop=1','The controversial \"mattress\" lyric was edited out of the updated track','TAYLOR SWIFT’S ANNOUNCEMENT of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in May revived discussion surrounding the album’s most controversial song, “Better Than Revenge.” As the anticipated album finally arrived, fans were quick to notice that the problematic lyrics had been replaced.\r\n\r\nThe original song featured the lyrics, “She’s not a saint, and she’s not what you think/She’s an actress, whoa/She’s better known for the things that she does /On the mattress, whoa.” In Swift’s newest release, the last lines were edited to, “He was a moth to the flame/She was holding the matches, whoa.”\r\n\r\nSwifties remain divided on whether the original should have been kept intact or updated for today’s sentiments. It wasn’t politically correct, but it was also written when the singer-songwriter was 18-years-old, and documents a critical growing pain in her career.','2023-07-09',6,7),(75,'Skrillex Taps Boys Noize for Thumping Summer Banger ‘Fine Day Anthem’','https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1202130374-1.jpg?w=657&h=493&crop=1','The single follows the producer\'s recent LPs, Quest for Fire and Don\'t Get Too Close','SKRILLEX HAS REUNITED with Boys Noize for a new single, “Fine Day Anthem.” The pair recently previewed the track during a show in Berlin and it marks their first collaboration since their dual 2019 EP Turn Off The Lights.\r\n\r\nThe cover art for the single, created by digital artist Thomas Harrington Rawle using both studio photography and manual digital painting, is intended to evoke ’90’s rave photos.

After news broke earlier this week that the Dumile’s widow, Jasmine, had raised concerns about his care at the time, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs St James’s, issued an apology.\r\n\r\n“I would like to offer our sincere condolences to Daniel’s family, friends and fans at this difficult time,” Hamish McLure, chief medical officer of the trust, said, per The Guardian. “I apologize that the care he received was not to the standard we would expect. Following his sad death we undertook a serious incident investigation and the report has been shared with Daniel’s family.”\r\n\r\nHe continued, “As a result we have put in place a number of actions and the wider learning from what happened is to be used as a teaching topic in a number of different clinical specialities. We also support the coroner’s recommendation for clearer national guidance and awareness in this area.”\r\n\r\nThe apology came after an inquest into Dumile’s death, during which the trust acknowledged there had been “missed opportunities” in his course of treatment. The rapper was admitted on Oct. 23, 2020 with breathing problems after taking new medication. In the emergency room at St James’s hospital he was given adrenaline, steroids, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 31, he collapsed following a reaction to a drug prescribed for blood pressure. That same day, Dumile died from angioedema, a sudden swelling often caused by an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\nIn the inquiry, assistant coroner Janine Wolstenholme confirmed that Dumile’s care plan was not complete and that doctors were given a “false reassurance” about his condition. Wolstenholme, who described the death as a “rare event,” said that when Dumile complained that the swelling in his throat, tongues, and lips was getting worse, it should have triggered a request for a review at the hospital.\r\n','2023-07-09',6,7),(77,'Wet Leg Deliver Ethereal Remix of Depeche Mode’s ‘Wagging Tongue’','https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-8uwU1w4om5ly.jpg?w=1422&h=1024&crop=1','The song originally appeared on the synth pop band\'s recent LP, Memento Mori','DEPECHE MODE HAVE tapped a series of artists to remix their recent song “Wagging Tongue,” including British group Wet Leg.

The two navigate Mission: Impossible-like scenes, with Presley Cash serving as their behind-the-scenes comms director, complete with tricky lasers and fight scenes against those who try to prevent them from absconding with what is rightfully Swift’s. The clever clip is of course a metaphor for her taking back her art from her former record label Big Machine, whose sale of her master recordings spurred her to rerecord her entire catalog before Lover.','2023-07-09',6,7),(79,'Transgender Care Ban Allowed to Take Effect in Tennessee, Appeals Panel Says','https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/07/08/multimedia/08nat-trans-tennessee-1-vbtl/08nat-trans-tennessee-1-vbtl-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp','The ruling on Saturday is the first time a federal court has allowed a law banning transition care to fully go into effect, amid a flurry of legal challenges across the country.','A federal appeals panel on Saturday said a Tennessee law that would ban hormone therapy and puberty blockers for transgender youth could go into effect, marking the first time a federal court has allowed a law banning transition care to fully take hold in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ruling, issued by a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, comes less than two weeks after a district court judge temporarily blocked the ban on hormone therapy and puberty blockers.
